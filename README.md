## NeosXS_Headless

Working with the Headless version of NeosXS
(this does not mean you can run this program without use of Neos at all)

Note: The Neos Headless App's StatusLabel is slow to update (10s) Spamming buttons will not make the process go faster.

### Installing

Step 1) Download `NeosXS_Headless.zip` from the Releases Page
Step 2) Extract the Zip file Somewhere. (Inside a Directory would be optimal)
Step 3) Run NeosXS_Headless.exe

Note: If you get a smart screen filter, it only says this because the application is unsigned
(So no, it is not a virus)

Step 4) Configure settings to your liking
(only change them if you 1. need to 2. know what you're doing)

Step 5) Start the Websocket

### Wine

NeosXS_Headless is not known to be able to run on wine. Please feel free to submit an issue if you have confirmed Wine to work.
